Our heuristics prioritized limiting the outcomes of certain states we were looking at. As mentioned in the outline of the assignment document, we limited how many of every item that could be made. Simple ones include only needing 1 of certain tools and crafting benches (furnace, crafting bench) to having varying weights for certain number thresholds for items. For instance having more than 8 cobblestone at a time was unnecessary since furnaces are the only craft that needs that many cobblestone so every outcome resulting in more than 8 would have a larger weight, putting it’s priority to be searched very low. We also added a heuristic to prioritize taking actions with certain tools, say if you had a stone_pickaxe and a wooden_pickaxe and the action was to mine cobblestone, you would of course want to mine that with the best available tool so we filtered out any action that we would have taken if it involved using an inferior tool if a superior one existed in the inventory. We also added a check in A* to not add any actions to our heap that had a certain priority in order to filter out certain states that we arrived at inefficiently.
